# **Asteroids (Python / Pygame)**

A modern recreation of the classic *Asteroids* arcade game, built from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
This project was part of a structured course, but I went well beyond the tutorials — implementing realistic physics, collision detection, object-oriented design, and gameplay balancing on my own.

## **Overview**

This version of Asteroids includes:
- A responsive ship with smooth rotation and thrust mechanics  
- Bullet shooting system with controlled rate of fire  
- Dynamic asteroid splitting with randomized velocity vectors  
- Collision detection between shots, asteroids, and the player  
- Progressive difficulty scaling and game-state tracking

## **What I Learned**

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- **Game loop design:** managing updates, draws, and event handling each frame  
- **Vector math and physics:** using `pygame.Vector2` for motion, rotation, and collision  
- **Object-oriented architecture:** clean separation between Player, Shot, and Asteroid classes  
- **Code performance and structure:** balancing readability with real-time responsiveness  
- **Version control workflows:** branching, pushing, and maintaining clean commits in Git

## **Tech Stack**

- Python 3.x  
- Pygame  
- Git & GitHub for version control
